The specification classifies the return value of Scanner.nextInt() as a high source, and the parameter of the method writeToDisk() as a low source. Furthermore, the specification does not allow flows of information from high to low. Hence, the specification states that no flow of information from the input integers to the disk can occur. Hence, the specification is faithful for the requirements.
