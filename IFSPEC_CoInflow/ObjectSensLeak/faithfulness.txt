The high source is stored in ObjectSensLeak.high, as captured by the RIFL policy.
The low sink is the input parameter of the A.out method, which prints it into System.out. 
No information may flow from the high to the low domain.
This is also captured by the RIFL policy, hence the specification is faithful.
