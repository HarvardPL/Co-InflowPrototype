The program consists of four classes A, B, C and simpleTypes. Class B and C extend class A. The class simpleTypes has a boolean field secret. In the main method of the class simpleTypes a variable object of type A is initialized with a new instance of an object of class B or C where the concrete class is chosen depending on the secret. Afterwards an new boolean value initialized with true is created. Then the created object is casted to the class B in a try catch block in case an exception is thrown it is catched and the boolena variable set to false. Finally, the value of the boolean variable is printed to standard output.
