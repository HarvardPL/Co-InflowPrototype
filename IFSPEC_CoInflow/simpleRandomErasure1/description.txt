The program consists of a single class simpleRandomErasure with a secret field secret. The program first assigns the secret to an output variable. Afterwards it generates a random boolean and then depending on the boolean variable assigns a random value to the output variable where the range of the random value depends on both the random boolean variable and the secret. Then the resulting value is printed to the standard output.
