Checks the syntactic correctness of a RIFL specification for
Java source code. The checker supports versions of RIFL up to
1.1.

To be applicable to a RIFL specification, the specification
must contain the following document type declaration: 
  <!DOCTYPE riflspec SYSTEM [dtd]>
Here, [dtd] is the path to a DTD for a version of RIFL for
Java source ode, e.g., "../rifl-JavaSourcecode-1.1.dtdâ€œ.

Note:
The syntax checker does not yet check whether declassification
expressions in escape hatches are syntactically correct JML
expressions.

To run the tool, call:
  java -jar rifl-syntaxchecker-1.1-dalvik.jar <rifl>,
where <rifl> is the path to the RIFL specification to be
checked.
