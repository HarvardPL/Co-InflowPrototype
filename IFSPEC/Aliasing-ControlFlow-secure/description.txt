The program creates two internal objects a and b that alias. 
If the secret is equal to 42, the value of an internal field of a is set to 2.
Else, the same field is also set to 2. 
Finally, the value of the same internal field of b is printed. 
This does not leak any information about the secret, as the field will have the same
value, not matter what the secret value is.
