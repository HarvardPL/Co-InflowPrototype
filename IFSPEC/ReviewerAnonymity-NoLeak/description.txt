This example models a simplified peer review process. The class ReviewProcess
provides public functions to add reviews and to send out notifications to the
authors (here simply by printing the reviews on the standard output).

The reviews are sorted before they are output.
This non-leaky version orders only based on review score and content.
In the leaky version (in a different directory), the sort order depends on the
reviewer identity.
