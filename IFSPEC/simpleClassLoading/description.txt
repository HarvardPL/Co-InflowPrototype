The program consists of a single class simpleClassLoading. The class simpleClassLoading has a boolean field secret. The program first gets access to the system's class loader enabling public access to the method findLoadedClass. This method returns null if the class was not loaded before. Afterwards it creates a new object of the class A or the class B depending on the secret boolean field. The it is checked whehther class A was loaded bythe class loader or not using the method findLoadedClass. The result of this check is printed to the standard output.
