We assign the high domain to the parameters name and street of the method setDeliveryAdr and the low domain to the fields name and adress of any Adress object. For the fields name and street of DAdress objects we assign the domain high. Furthermore, we specify that flow can only occur only from low to high. In summary, we specify that flow from the parameters of setDeliveryAdr to the fields of Adress objects is forbidden, which faithfully realizes our security requirement, that delivery adress data may not influence billing adress data.
