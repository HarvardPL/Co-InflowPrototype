This example models a simplified peer review process. The class ReviewProcess
provides public functions to add reviews and to send out notifications to the
authors (here simply by printing the reviews on the standard output).

The reviews are sorted before they are output.
In this leaky version, the sort order depends on the reviewer identity.
The non-leaky version (in a different directory) orders only based on review
score and content.
