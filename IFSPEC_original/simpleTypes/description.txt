The program consists of four classes A, B, C and simpleTypes. Class B and C extend class A. The class simpleTypes has a boolean field secret. In the main method of the class simpleTypes a variable object of type A is initialized with a new instance of an object of class B or C where the concrete class is chosen depending on the secret. Afterwards the value of an instanceof check with respect to the class B is printed to standard output.
