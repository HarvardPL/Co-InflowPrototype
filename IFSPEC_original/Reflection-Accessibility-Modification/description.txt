The program contains a secret boolean field in the class SimpleReflection. According to the boolean, the accessibility of password in SecureSafe is set using Java reflection. In a try-catch block it is then tried to access this field. If the secret was true, then this access throws an error, as accessing a private field in this case is not possible, and the message "The secret was true" is printed to standard output. Otherwise, no exception is thrown and the message "The secret was false" is printed to standard output.
