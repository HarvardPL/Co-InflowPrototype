The program abstracts from a login scenario in which a user has a fixed number of login tries before the program blocks any further login attempts. After a successful login the user is allowed to request access to an URL. The class PasswordManager of the program stores the password, the number of unsuccesful login attempts, the maximal number of login attempts and whether the last login was successful or not. Moreover, it provides the method  tryLogin(String tryedPassword) and requestUrl(String url). The method checks first whether the number of logins does not yet exceed the bounds of maximal logins. If this is the case it checks whether the given password matches the passward stored in this instance of the password manager adjusting the status and the number of logins accordingly. Afterwards, the method prints the String "Login Attempt Completed" to the standard output.
