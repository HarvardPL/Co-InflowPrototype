The program contains a secret boolean field in the class SimpleReflection, and 
public voolean in the same class. 
According to the public boolean, the accessibility of password in SecureSafe is set using Java reflection. 
In a try-catch block it is then tried to access this field. 
If the public boolean was true, then this access throws an error, as accessing a private field in this case is not possible, and the message "The boolean was true" is printed to standard output. 
Otherwise, no exception is thrown and the message "The boolean was false" is printed to standard output.
This does not consitute a leak, as only publicly available information is printed.
